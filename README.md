# Analysis and Interpretation of Biological Data - Assignment 1  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains the submission for **Assignment 1** of the course **BT3041 ‚Äì Analysis and Interpretation of Biological Data**. The assignment involves analyzing **chlorophyll levels (chlorophyll a and b)** in plant samples from Deciduous and Evergreen forests. The dataset consists of 100 samples (50 from each forest type), and various statistical and visualization techniques are used for analysis.  

## üìÇ Repository Contents  
- **AIBD1.ipynb** ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook containing the complete Python code for data analysis and visualization.  
- **AIBD1.pdf** ‚Äì PDF report summarizing the analysis, statistical tests, and visualizations.  
- **Assignment-I.pdf** ‚Äì The original problem statement and assignment instructions.  

## üìù Analysis Overview  
The following tasks were performed in this assignment:  
1. **Histogram Visualization**  
   - Chlorophyll distributions for Deciduous and Evergreen forests.  
   - Overall histogram without separating forest types.  
2. **Density Plot Comparison**  
   - Combined density plot of chlorophyll a and b levels.  
3. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for chlorophyll a and b.  
4. **Boxplot Comparison**  
   - Distribution comparison of chlorophyll levels between forest types.  
5. **Variance Comparison**  
   - Statistical F-test to compare variance between chlorophyll a and b.  
6. **Hypothesis Testing for Mean Difference**  
   - Paired t-test to determine if chlorophyll a levels are significantly higher than chlorophyll b.  

## üìä Results Summary  
- **Chlorophyll a** levels were observed to be consistently higher than **Chlorophyll b** across all datasets.  
- Variance in **Chlorophyll a** was significantly greater than **Chlorophyll b** in both forest types.  
- **Statistical significance** was confirmed through hypothesis testing (p-values < 0.05).  

## üöÄ How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIBD1.git
   ```
2. Open the **AIBD1.ipynb** notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.  

## üîó Code and Data Access  
The code can also be accessed on **Google Colab**:
